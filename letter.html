Happy birthday Tif!
</p>

<p>
As you have probably guessed, you are now 23 - congrats! :’) I know this isn’t an ideal birthday card, but to be honest, with us spending 100% of our time together, it wasn’t exactly possible to sneakily buy a real card... we even get the mail together so I can’t get one delivered. But in the spirit of the brave new world we live in, I decided to create a modern day e-card for you, right on your new website!
</p>

This last year has been a crazy year. Can you believe we’re living through a pandemic? But I feel like we have grown nothing but stronger. I cherish our memories of cuddling on the couch, sharing our favorite shows together. Even our NY trip, which seemed like ages ago, was within this last year! And we continue to grow our culinary abilities together, and dug deeply into our inner baker spirits :)

I know this year hasn’t been easy for you. Transitioning to a post-grad life can be tough. I know you already know this, but I am with you all the way. I promise I will be right by your side as you take your next steps in your career. Besides, how can I go without the person who turns everything into an organized shopping list, organizes my drawers, makes our bed, and documents everything we eat? (I’ll always nag when we’re doing laundry though...) I’m so lucky to have someone who gracefully chases their career and yet seems to have the mental energy to be my rock every night.
</p>

<p>
If this year proved anything, it’s that we can tackle anything life can throw at us. We know we can survive 24/7 trapped in a small apartment - the rest is cakewalk right? No matter what, know that I will always love you.

Happy birthday fren :’)

P.S. I actually had to learn HTML and CSS for this. Please forgive my nonexistent creativity. Also, I really wanted to add images to this page, but considering I was uploading this to Github, I didn't want your future Github to slow down with HD iPhone pictures haha. Also, I saw you judging my page margins when you were on my website... to I made them extra thicc for you.
