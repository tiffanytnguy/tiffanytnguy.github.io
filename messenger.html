                    Messenger is a messaging app and platform. At its core, Messenger helps you instantly reach the people you’re close to without a data plan, for free. My goal was to improve the navigation of certain chats and messages within Facebook with pins.

                        To fulfill these research goals, I did some market research on other competitors, looked through customer reviews on the app store, and conducted 3 in-depth interviews with common and uncommon users of the app.

                        01 — Messenger distances itself from competitors by offering many features to further personalize the chatting experience. However, with those new features, it can be difficult to navigate through conversations and messages. Other competitors have resolved this issue by pinning conversations and/or messages or having a sorting feature.
                        <br><br>
                        02 — The process to navigate a specific message or chat is a long process that can be simplified.
                        <br><br>
                        03 — Messenger contains many features that doesn't focus on the optimizing the user experience - accessing messages efficiently and having the app related to only messages, not having a page dedicated to the news (which is more of a Facebook app feature rather than a Messenger one).
                        <br><br>
                        04 — There is a need from users to sort chats and pin specific messages for user accessibility.

                    <div id="row2">
                        When solving the original problem of difficult navigation through the clutter of Messenger, I realized that messenger apps will always be cluttered with a list of chats. Looking closely at my problem, I primarily wanted to focus on how to easily funnel the process of navigating through a chat list or within a chat. A solution to resolve the strenuous process of navigating through a chat list to find a specific chat or going through thousands of messages to find a specific message was to enable users to pin chats or messages.
                        <br><br>
                        Going back through the interviews and discussing with peers, I found that Slack was a prime example of providing a product that allows users to easily navigate through their own chats. As an avid user of Messenger as well as an avid user of Slack, I was able to see the successful use of a 'pin' product.
                        <br><br>
                        For Messenger, I, along with my peers, found that memorizing important dates, places, links can be extremely difficult. We often resort to copy and paste the message in our endless doc of notes or a notepad. With an addition of the Messenger 'pin', this painstaking process of sliding through endless chats and messages would be reduced.

                        This would help make space for pinned chats.

                        <p>Have the pin feature be visually accessible on the current screen.</p>
                        Take in mind: Would users have to swipe a chat to manually pin the chat? Is there a pin icon that would locate users to a new page to pin chats? Would other content need to be removed or relocated in order for the pin feature to be visually accessible?
                        <br><br>
                        <p>Have pins located on the current screen without adding more clutter to the Messenger screen.</p> 
                        Users might want pinned chats to be displayed at the top of the screen but a concern that might pop up would be how chats below would be navigated. Within chats, would pinned messages be displayed on top or within the chat information screen (by clicking the chat name)?

                        — To prevent a long list of pinned messages placed at the top within each chat, there would be a pinned section on the top displaying 1 or more pinned messages. Users will have the ability to access all other pinned messages by clicking the section.
                        <br><br>
                        — To prevent a a long list of pinned chats placed at the top of the Chats screen, I inputted another screen page - Pinned Chats - to accessed the chats pinned. This would help users be able to access pinned chats without scrolling down the current Chats page to access recent chats.
                        <br><br>
                        — I removed the screen asking users to either pin a message/chat or cancel because I wanted the UX to be as smooth as possible instead of taking a preventative approach with a confirmation message.
                        <br><br>
                        — Replaced the current blue fill with a blue bar on the left of the pinned message to indicate a pinned chat. The current blue fill was overall too bold and took a large chunk of the screen; whereas, the new design offered more white space.
                        <br><br>
                        — To access all pinned messages within a specific chat, users could swipe down the pinned message section (blue section at the top). This relieved the long process of accessing all pinned messages within the chat's information screen.
