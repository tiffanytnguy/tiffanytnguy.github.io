                        One key quote during the user testings that made me take a major change on the prototype was "I don't like the confirmation message because you want the UX to be as smooth as possible instead of taking a preventative approach with a confirmation message. It is better to offer an easy way to rectify the mistake, such as an undo button... Are more people going to make mistakes or are they going to use [the feature] correctly?"

                    This was an exciting and fun project for me to work on as it provides real value, involved a ton of research, and close attention to interactions. This was my first individual product case study and I learned some important takeaways from this project related to working on projects, in general:
                    <br><br>
                    <p>When finding users to interview or test on, always have an uncommon user — someone who isn’t a primary user of the product e.g. uses the product in a non-conventional way.</p>
                    To keep note of any edge or wild cases of outlier users, it was good to interview those you used Messenger in an uncommonly way.
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Process is not linear. </p>
                    Initially, my original feature that I came up with was to have a 'delete all' function. However, I taking in commments from my mentor, I needed to take a different route of developing an app to find efficient pathways of accessing messages and chats.
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Taking further steps to solidify a concrete idea and ultimate solution.</p>
                    I took measures to make sure the derived solution was practical and would provide high impact by creating a SWOT analysis and Feasibility / Impact chart with my ideas.

                    <p>Implementing other features to access messages efficiently —</p>
                    This is one solution to solve Messenger's long navigation process and clutter of space. Exploring other alternative solutions and conducting user testings favoring different solutions would help identify the most successful solution.
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Applying additional research methods —</p>
                    To further improve on the feature, conducting other additional research methods such as A/B Testing or click analysis would help get more feedback and prove if the new feature is actually efficient.
