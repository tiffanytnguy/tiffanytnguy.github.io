                        When solving the original problem of difficult navigation through the clutter of Messenger, I realized that messenger apps will always be cluttered with a list of chats. Looking closely at my problem, I primarily wanted to focus on how to easily funnel the process of navigating through a chat list or within a chat. A solution to resolve the strenuous process of navigating through a chat list to find a specific chat or going through thousands of messages to find a specific message was to enable users to pin chats or messages.

                        01 — Messenger distances itself from competitors by offering many features to further personalize the chatting experience. However, with those new features, it can be difficult to navigate through conversations and messages. Other competitors have resolved this issue by pinning conversations and/or messages or having a sorting feature. 
                        <br><br>
                        02 — The process to navigate a message or chat is a long process that can be simplified. 
                        <br><br>
                        03 — Messenger contains many features that don't focus on optimizing the user goal - accessing messages efficiently and having the app related to only messages, not having a page dedicated to the news (which is more of a Facebook app feature rather than a Messenger one). 
                        <br><br>
                        04 — There is a need for users to sort chats and pin specific messages for user accessibility.

                        Going back through the interviews and discussing with peers, I found that Slack was a prime example of providing a product that allows users to easily navigate through their chats. As an avid user of Messenger as well as an avid user of Slack, I was able to see the successful use of a 'pin' product.
                        <br><br>
                        For Messenger, I, along with my peers, found that memorizing important dates, places, links can be extremely difficult. We often resort to copy and paste the message in our endless doc of notes or a notepad. With an addition of the Messenger 'pin', this painstaking process of sliding through endless chats and messages would be reduced.

                    This was an exciting and fun project for me to work on as it provides real value, involved a ton of research, and close attention to interactions. This was my first individual product case study and I learned some important takeaways from this project related to working on projects, in general:
                    <br><br>
                    <p>When finding users to interview or test on, always have an uncommon user — someone who isn’t a primary user of the product e.g. uses the product in a non-conventional way.</p>
                    <p>Process is not linear. </p>
                    <p>Always ask for feedback and reiterate.</p>

                <div class="sectionSubTextNon">
                    <p>Implementing other features to access messages efficiently —</p>
                    This is one solution to solve Messenger's long navigation process and clutter of space. Exploring other alternative solutions and conducting user testings favoring different solutions would help identify the most successful solution.
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Further refining the 'Pins' screen —</p>
                    The current 'Messages' tab within the 'Pins' screen is not connected to the slide down view of pinned messages. Connecting or having the same screen for pinned messages would bring greater accessibility and navigation.
