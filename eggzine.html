                    <div id="row2">During my academic career at the University of California, Berkeley, I was grateful enough to be enrolled into the Graphic Design Principles DeCal, instructed by <a href="https://innovativedesign.club/" target="_blank"><b>Innovative Design</b></a>. The class covered the conceptual and theoretical aspects of design such as color theory, typography, branding, portfolio, UX/UI design, etc. The course was designed specifically for students who are technically proficient in Adobe programs (Photoshop, Illustrator) and were looking to learn design principles in order to apply their skills to projects.</div>

                    <div id="row1"><section class="titleText">I decided to make a zine dedicated to the fundamental and basic ways to cooking an egg.</section></div>
                    <div id="row2">I initially wanted to create a mini cook book, providing alternative ways to cook an egg. However, I went onto another idea to illustratively note 5 ways to cook an egg because I mainly wanted to exercise my skills of word placement and typography.</div>

                    <div id="row2">
                        <p>1. Focus on word placement and typography.</p>
                        Although I did note the specific steps in how to cook the egg, I mainly wanted to incorporate the process of cooking the egg through illustration. Viewers themselves would get a sense on how to cook the egg mainly based on the way the illustrations were drawn and laid out.
                        <br><br>
                        <p>2. Have the zine look interactive.</p>
                        To make the zine more interactive and to further instruct those who come across my zine, I had typography incorporated into the illustrations to guide the viewer's eye in the main action of cooking an egg. For example, in order to make a scrambled egg, you need to whisk an egg - in the illustration, the word 'SCAMBLED' is warped in a swirl to indicate the whisking gesture in the process of making scrambled eggs.
                        <br><br>
                        <p>3. Inform and instruct the viewer.</p>
                        Also, I wanted to allow viewers to imagine themselves as if they were cooking the egg by having mostly aerial views incorporation into the illustrations. Viewers themselves would look at the hands and imagine themselves participating into the fun cooking activity. In addition, minutes of how long the egg would take to cook are noted on the bottom right corner of every second page to further inform and instruct the viewer on the amount of time it would take to cook the egg.
