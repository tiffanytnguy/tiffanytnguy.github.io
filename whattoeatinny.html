                        <p>Including direct links to social media pages or Yelp —</p>
                        Adding an icon hyperlinking to social media pages or Yelp reviews would very much help other users to be more inclined to eat at a certain restaurant based on a whole data of reviews.

                        <p>More animated features —</p>
                        Adding more animation to my site would improve the interactive space that my website offered, rather than have items fixed to the page itself. 
                        <br><br>
                        <p>Add more contrasted and bright colors —</p>
                        The current site looked too muted and it was difficult to clearly identify certain features of the site, especially the background. Updating the colors to be vibrant and contrasted with one another would enhance the overall visual experience.

                <p>Responsive —</p>
                To keep my site inclusive to all users - those using different devices (phone, laptop, ipad, etc.), I think another improvement would be to keep my site responsive and compatible with different users.  
                <br><br>
                <p>Include icons to insinuate the type of ethnic cuisine —</p>
                To give further context on the specific location, including icons would help insinuate the type of ethnic cuisine one is feeling hungry for at the moment.
                <br><br>
                <p>Have whole site within one page —</p>
                Having the whole site within one page instead of linekd to pages would help tie in all elements of the page in a concise and smooth manner.
