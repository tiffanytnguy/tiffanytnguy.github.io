Within those 30 days, I experienced a high of artistic creativity, burnout, exploration, and pure accomplishment. In addition, I was able to hone and expand my skills in design and Adobe Illustrator.</div>

                        <p>Step 01 â€” Creating a mood board, list out ideas, look for inspiration</p>
                        I mainly collected inspiration from daily life and Pinterest. As I began to start this challenge, I created a private board on Pinterest that would exponentionally grow as I continued this project. I also continually added onto my Note list whenever an idea happened to pop up.

                        <p>Step 02 â€” Sketch</p>
                        Once I had an idea in mind, I would dabble more into it by producing quick sketches using my Apple Pencil and my iPad Pro.

                        <p>Step 03 â€” Creating the illustration</p>
                        Finalizing my sketch, I would import it into my Mac and begin developing the illustration on Adobe Illustrator.
                        <br><br>
                        <p>Step 04 â€” The post</p>
                        After finalizing the illustration, I would post the original illustration in png form with a close-up of the work, along with the initial idea I sketched up. My initial sketch was not always synced with the final result, but in a way, it brought a new flow of ideas to form while in the process of illustrating.</div>

Of course - I also expected that I would be mentally and creatively challenge, expanding my skills beyond the boundaries of comfort. Looking back, having gone through the phases of burnout, imposter syndrome, artistic creativity, exploration, etc., I have inherently gained a sense of true accomplishment. Over the 30 days, I learned a lot on how I process and structure my mind when working, how I mentally got through the burnouts and stress, and more so about how I refined my skills and efficiency.</div>
