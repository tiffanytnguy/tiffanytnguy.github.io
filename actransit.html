                        Getting to class is an absolute struggle, especially when classes are far out of reach. When it comes to someone living far away from campus, the AC Transit is the way to go. However, the bus often is inaccurate and inconsistent when it comes to bus arrival times. At certain peaks of the day, the bus becomes extremely cramped, often requiring other riders to wait for the next one.
                        <br><br>
                        As a possible solution to these problems, I redesigned the AC Transit mobile app and bus stops to make the travel to and from campus more inclusive and reliable to bus riders.

There were suggestions to apply multiple buses for the stop sign, as some bus lines might delay and, therefore, multiple buses might stop by at the same stop at the same time.</section>

My prior knowledge of design was to simplify complex and overwhelming data into a simple, easily-digestible visual graphic. By working on this case study, I focused less on the ‘aesthetics’ on design and focused more on the approach. I drew my approach to innovation through accessing the needs of the people, the feasibility of the product, and the success of that product.</div>

                    <p>Adding another feature that can add more efficiency and accuracy to bus arrival —</p>
                    One of the bugs which prevented others from arriving to class on time was the bus delays. The bus was found to be unreliable to many students due to the inconsistent and inaccurate arrival times noted in the Transit app. In addition, during peak times, many students find it difficult to get on the bus home because the bus is too crowded. Having an additional feature, in which users can ping the bus location and notify other users of the amount of people on the bus, would help resolve this bug.                     <br><br>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Implementing other features to make the AC Transit more accessible to everyone —</p>
                    Having a voice feature would aid those who have trouble hearing. Similar to traffic stops and lights, a voice feature would note bus arrival times every 15 minutes or 5 minutes before the bus arrives.
