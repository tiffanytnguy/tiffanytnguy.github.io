When it comes to someone living far away from campus, the AC Transit is the way to go. However, the bus often is inaccurate and inconsistent when it comes to bus arrival times, and bus arrival is hard to visually access. At certain peaks of the day, the bus becomes extremely cramped, often requiring other riders to wait for the next one.</div>

                        I decided to keep some original layouts from both the bus stop and mobile app - i.e., bus schedule, lined up bus lines on mobile app based on bus arrival time. For the the bus stop, I tried different ways to illustrate an incoming bus line - through interchanging color rings and line diagram.

I drew my approach to innovation through assessing the needs of the people, the feasibility of the product, and the success of that product.</div>

                    <p>Adding another feature that can add more accuracy to bus arrival —</p>
                    One of the bugs which prevented others from arriving to class on time was the bus delays. The bus was found to be unreliable by many students due to the inconsistent and inaccurate arrival times noted in the Transit app. In addition, during peak times, many students find it difficult to get on the bus home because the bus is too crowded. Having an additional feature, in which users can ping the bus location and notify other users of the amount of people on the bus, would help resolve this bug.                    <br><br>
                    <p>Implementing other features to make the AC Transit more accessible to everyone —</p>
                    Having a voice feature would aid those who have trouble hearing. Similar to traffic stops and lights, a voice feature would note bus arrival times every 15 minutes or 5 minutes before the bus arrives.
