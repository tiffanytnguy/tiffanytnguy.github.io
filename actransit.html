                    Getting to class is an absolute struggle, especially when classes are far out of reach. When it comes to someone living far away from campus, the AC Transit is the way to go. However, the bus often is inaccurate and inconsistent when it comes to bus arrival times. At certain peaks of the day, the bus becomes extremely cramped, often requiring other riders to wait for the next one.
                    <br><br>
                    To solve these problems, I redesigned the AC Transit mobile app and bus stops to make the travel to and from campus more inclusive and reliable to bus riders.

                    <div id="row2">I wanted to redesign the current Transit bus stops to have it be more responsible for visibly showing late bus stops and accurate bus times. I wanted to make the bus stop more accessible for people who either regularly used the app and those who didn’t use the app, and those relatively near the bus stop. In addition, I aimed to rebrand the AC Transit bus stop and mobile app. With my redesign, students would feel more confident in their campus travels.</div>

                        I worked with three other designers to improve the campus travel experience, who felt that as students, campus terrain was often difficult to navigate around, to, and from. We interviewed three people each to compile insights, conducted secondary research to verify bugs other students faced that was a common problem within the scope of our community, and presented our findings to the class. After the user research stage of this case, we diverged to design our own individual solutions.

                    <div id="row1">I decided to move on with this app idea because I think that it would solve the inaccurate bus arrival time and students being late to the bus issues.

                        I researched more on how to apply inclusive design, especially to those with impaired sight. One of the recommendations was to add pattern, rather than apply exclusively to color. To differentiate the minutes leading up to the upcoming bus arrival, I used stripes - varying in width.
                        <br><br>
                        To inform other users about the branding changes, I added a button that directs uses to the icon key, which identifies the certain icons depicted on the app.
