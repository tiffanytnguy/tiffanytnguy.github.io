                        Collecting all my findings, and understanding the company’s goals and the user pain points, I was then able to wireframe the first redesign, noting the essential components needed - Contact Page, media sections, etc. With wireframes, I was able to focus on the user experience of the page and how each page functions. Initially I focused on accessibility and community when ideating layouts. 
                        <br><br>
                        I added sizing charts linked within the original product pages because it would help people reference which size works best for their own body type. To bring notice and access the limited-edition t-shirt of the month, I added a section on the landing page as well as a section at the top of each page highlighting the featured t-shirt. 
                        <br><br>
                        As the target audience is mainly Treehouse students who value learning and a community, I inputted a section dedicated to the community. With this section, I think users would feel more enticed to buy products and share them with their peers - increasing sales.

                    Taking in feedback from the wireframes as well as going through typography hierarchies, layouts, and UX content strategy, I was able to implement more drastic changes to the final prototype.
                    <br><br>
                    Initially, I looked back at my research findings to understand and craft the company’s mission as well as understand the target users. Next, I created a moodboard to hone down the personality of the site and company, which then led me to build a branding kit (consisting of colors, new redesign of the logo, icons, etc.) to establish the design components leading to the final mockup. During this stage, I also did additional research on other similar retail companies and crafted an inspoBoard.

                    As with any UX Design Project, I realized and learned that UX Design is not entirely linear. Throughout this entire process of redesigning the ShirtsbyMike site, I kept going back and forth through many of the steps to reaffirm by new insights and connect them back to the initial findings.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to this new learning, I also learned that UX Design is not about solving the visual problems when it comes to the user experience but also the text content as well.

                    <p>Get more tangible data to get more insight —</p>
                    Although I did craft a target user persona and create a hypothetical journey map of a potential user, I do wish I got more tangible data - i.e., interviewing 3 Treehouse students and noting their pain points, concerns, and interests from interacting with the site. 
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Iterate a new product or feature —</p>
                    I wish to iterate a new type of product or feature, other than the current shirts to entice others to join the ShirtsbyMike community. A probable idea that I thought of was to have users be able to submit designs and have the community vote. The most popular design would be featured for next month’s latest shirt!
