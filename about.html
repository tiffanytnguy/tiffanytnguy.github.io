                <div class="aboutHeader">Hello, I’m Tiffany — a Product Designer, based from the Bay Area.</div>
                Intrigued by the intersection of design, technology, and educational spaces, I’m interested about designing accessible and inclusive experiences that shape how we interact with digital tools and each other.
                <br><br><br>
                <div class="pageSectionTitle">Background</div>
                Previously, I studied Art History and Media at the University of California, Berkeley where I focused on the power and complexity of visual spaces. During my time at Cal, I worked a graphic designer, illustrator, and design lead with a variety of student organizations that helped me emerge and hone my skills as a digital creator, a team spirit animal, and a helpful mentor.<br><br>
                In regards to my experience, I’ve worked with early-stage startups as the sole designer, with focuses on self-improvement and fair compensation among underrepresented groups. 
                <br><br><br>
                <div class="pageSectionTitle">Why Product Design?</div>
                Before my current perception of design as a process of science and engineering towards a goal that ultimately strives for improvement or solution to a problem, I primarily viewed design as aesthetics - whether it be through our public spaces, our own private spaces, or the alluring look of food Instagram feeds. However, once delving more into the theories and concepts of design through classes, online articles, documentaries, and during my own traditional and digital art practice, I found design to transcend single disciplines with its application towards web, mobile, software, fashion, health, social spaces, etc.<br><br>
                Design, in general, has enabled me to step back and perceive a problem through a different countermeasure and solve it accordingly. I have been pushed to explore different genres of design, through an art historical background, and to become flexible to multiple mediums and later obliterate my comfort zone by trying new techniques to solve these social and visual problems. My yearning and drive to be part of such a robust and ever-changing industry is rooted in these perceptions of design.<br><br>
                I have yet to fully succeed in my field, but rather I have expanded my knowledge and skills even further to master design for myself. That is what I love about design - the constant push towards improvement and evolution by making steps towards social impact.

                <div class="pageSectionTitle">Indulgances</div>
                Aside from design, I enjoy watching the intricacy of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi28pEbMdTw&list=PLKtIunYVkv_RwB_yx1SZrZC-ddhxyXanh" target="_blank"><b>Gourmet Makes</b></a> series from <i>Bon Appetit</i> and the wholesome space of BBC’s the <i>Great British Baking Show</i>. Other than that, I like to engross myself in cat videos, puns, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrPhx9O5lRphp4dc4uBKOu_lkN333B9VU"><b>inspirational talks</b></a>.
